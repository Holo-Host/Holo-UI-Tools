## Code

This section is for actual code and code libraries relevant to Holo UI development.

### Current Tools

#### Internal 

The current primary internal tools are (The goal is to have UI code for the following tools):

##### Submodules

The following are submodules of this git repository

1. an empty 'scaffold' app framework
  * [https://github.com/Holo-Host/hc-react-redux-framework](https://github.com/Holo-Host/hc-react-redux-framework)
2. a separate library of just the reusable Holo UI components themselves
  * goes here
3. the 1) empty 'scaffold' app framework from above, but that also includes the 2) Holo UI components library from above
  * goes here
 
The following are some key things to remember about using git repositories with submodules:

1. When you clone a repository with submodules use `git clone --recursive <project url>`
2. You can refresh the submodule at any time by going into the submodule folder and running `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. When pushing to the a parent repository (like this one), be sure to force git to check that all changes to submodules have already been committed and pushed to their respective repositories first by running `git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand`
3. For reference see: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)


#### External

The current primary external tools are:

* React
* Redux
* Material UI
* Storybook

Additional packages and libraries support the primary tools in various ways.
